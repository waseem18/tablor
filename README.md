#### Development details
* Currently entire logic is presented in `index.js` and some helper functions in `utils.js`
* `app.js` imports `index.js` - `app.js` is used for testing code written in `index.js`
* `sample-program.js` contains the code which at the end user would write using our library.


Note: Currently I'm completely busy with my office work. Will start working on it as soon as I can!
